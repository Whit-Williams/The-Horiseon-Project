# The-Horiseon-Project
Welcome to the Horiseon Project.

The main objective of this challenge was to introduce refractor code to the existing codebase, with the aim of improving the accessibility of the Horiseon web page.

Following the objective, I have introduced the following:

- [Page Title](#page-title)
- [Working Link](#working-link)
- [Consolidated CSS Selectors](#consolidated-css-selectors)
- [Alt Attributes](#alt-attributes)
- [CSS Comments](#css-comments)
- [Bonus Features](#bonus-features)

## Page Title

What: Added the title "Horiseon - Homepage" to the title element.

Why: This confirms the web page being visited, also allowing users to track where they are on the website.

How: By adding the text "Horiseon - Homepage" to the "title" element in the head section.


## Working Link 

What: Fixed a broken link from the navigation bar to the "Search Engine Optimization" section of the page.

Why: So that all aspects of the navigation bar are functional. 

How: By adding the associated id attribute of the section to the div tag, linking it with the existing link element that had been identified with the same id.


## Consolidated CSS Selectors

What: Consolidated some of the CSS selectors on the style sheet.

Why: For two reasons - less latency and faster response times. But also to tidy up the code for ease of navigation and increased readability (in line with the Scout Rule). 

How: By combining any seperate selectors with the same style properties.


## Alt Attributes

 What: Added alt attributes to images and icons.

Why: To offer a text alternative for those who cannot see the images.

How: By adding the "alt" attribute in the opening tag of each image/icon. 

*No text descriptions were added to the alt attributes in this project as the images/icons are decorative. This is in line with the [W3C website guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#:~:text=If%20the%20image%20is,information%20from%20the%20page%3F) I found.*


## CSS Comments

What: Added comments to the CSS style sheet.

Why: To clarify the purpose of the code.

How: By adding comments above each selector, describing their function. 


## Bonus features

1. Added an underline property to the navigation bar that activates once the link is hovered over. This is to increase ease of navigation.

How I did it: By adding an a:hover selector and underline property.

2. Added landmarks to the HTML code to provide a clear structure, following the guidelines of semantic HMTL. This in turn will enhance user experience and readability.

How I did it: By adding header, nav, main and footer elements to the relevant sections.

3. Changed the colour contrast between the text and background within the "benefits" section, to increase readability. 

How I did it: By making the background a slightly darker shade of blue.
